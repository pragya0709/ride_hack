# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### About the project

Creating a unified e-pharmacy platform that provides customers with cost-effective options for a wide range of medications. 


Our objective is to establish an **all-inclusive** online pharmacy platform that acts as a convenient solution for users' medication requirements. This platform enables users to easily explore and buy a diverse selection of medications at competitive prices. 


### Issues Resolved

* Our platform is designed to empower users by offering a distinctive feature - the capability to discover the **most economical** options for their medication requirements on different online platforms. We acknowledge that affordability is a major concern for numerous individuals when purchasing medications, and our website provides a comprehensive solution to address this issue.
* Addressing the primary concern of brand monopoly. We have enhanced our search algorithm to give priority to alternative brands that offer more favorable deals while keeping the salt composition unchanged. When users search for a particular medication, our platform will not only show options from the leading brands but also emphasize alternative brands that offer similar or improved pricing.
